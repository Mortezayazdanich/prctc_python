# Python Practice Projects (prctc_python)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Python practice repository! This is where I'm storing the projects and exercises I complete as I learn Python, starting with challenges from freeCodeCamp.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a log of my progress and a collection of small projects aimed at building my Python skills. My initial focus is on completing projects from the freeCodeCamp Python curriculum.

## Projects Included

Here's a list of the projects currently in this repository:

1.  **Caesar's Cypher**
    * **Description:** A simple cyphering program that I made when I was learning about strings, and then modified it to get text and cypher it using Caesar's algorithm
    * **Source:** I got the main idea for this project from FreeCodeCamp
    * **Key Learnings:** - Defining and using functions. - String manipulation and leveraging built-in string methods. - Implementing algorithmic logic.
      
2.  **Vigenere Cypher**
    * **Description:** A program that implements the Vigenere cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This was a step up in complexity from the Caesar cipher.
    * **Source:** Inspired by concepts learned in freeCodeCamp and further personal exploration.
    * **Key Learnings:** -Working with multiple character mappings based on a keyword. -Looping through text and a keyword simultaneously. -Advanced string manipulation and modular arithmetic for character shifting. -Building on foundational function and string concepts from previous projects.


## How to Use

Currently, these projects are primarily for my learning.

## My Learning Goals

I aim to solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals and gradually move on to more complex projects. I plan to update this repository as I continue my learning journey regularly.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
