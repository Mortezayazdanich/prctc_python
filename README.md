# Python Practice Projects (prctc_python)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Python practice repository! This is where I'm storing the projects and exercises I complete as I learn Python, starting with challenges from freeCodeCamp.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a log of my progress and a collection of small projects aimed at building my Python skills. My initial focus is on completing projects from the freeCodeCamp Python curriculum.

## Projects Included

Here's a list of the projects currently in this repository:

1.  **Caesar's Cypher**
    * **Description:** A simple cyphering program that I made when I was learning about strings, and then modified it to get text and cypher it using Caesar's algorithm
    * **Source:** I got the main idea for this project from FreeCodeCamp
    * **Key Learnings:** - Defining and using functions. - String manipulation and leveraging built-in string methods. - Implementing algorithmic logic.
      
2.  **Vigenere Cypher**
    * **Description:** A program that implements the Vigenere cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This was a step up in complexity from the Caesar cipher.
    * **Source:** Inspired by concepts learned in freeCodeCamp and further personal exploration.
    * **Key Learnings:** -Working with multiple character mappings based on a keyword. -Looping through text and a keyword simultaneously. -Advanced string manipulation and modular arithmetic for character shifting. -Building on foundational function and string concepts from previous projects.
  
3.  **Luhn Algorithm Credit Card Validator**
    * **Description:** A Python script that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. It checks if a given card number is plausible according to this checksum formula. The script includes input cleaning and a simple interactive command-line interface.
    * **Source:** This project implements the Luhn algorithm, a widely known checksum formula. (If you got the idea from a specific freeCodeCamp challenge or another resource, you can mention it here.)
    * **Features:**
        * Cleans card numbers by removing spaces and hyphens.
        * Performs a basic length check (13-19 digits).
        * Correctly implements the Luhn algorithm steps (doubling digits, summing, modulo check).
        * Provides an interactive loop for validating multiple card numbers.
        * Includes error handling for empty or improperly formatted input.
    * **How to Run:**
        1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `luhn_validator.py`).
        2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
        3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
        4. Run the script using: `python luhn_validator.py`
        5. Enter card numbers when prompted. Type 'q' to quit.
    * **Key Learnings:**
        * Implementing a specific algorithm (Luhn's checksum).
        * Advanced string manipulation (cleaning input, reversing, slicing).
        * Conditional logic for algorithm steps (e.g., handling doubled digits greater than 9).
        * Using loops and list comprehensions for processing digits.
        * Robust error handling with `try-except` blocks for `ValueError`.
        * Structuring code with clear functions, docstrings, and type hints.
        * Creating a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) with a main loop.
    * **Status:** Completed


## How to Use

Currently, these projects are primarily for my learning.

## My Learning Goals

I aim to solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals and gradually move on to more complex projects. I plan to update this repository as I continue my learning journey regularly.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
